![GitHub Preview](/src/assets/img/github.preview.png)

No bundler. This is not a 150 MB starter.

Magic.. it's size is only **889ko** ! Incredible !

And it works with ES6 modules.. wow

No npm install, yarn, nope.

Just do a quick






    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080







and there you have your server running.

FYI: Just to prototype quick ideas. Keep it simple.
